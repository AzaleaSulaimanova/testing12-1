I might never be
Your knight in shining armor
I might never be the one
You take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight

When I first saw you
From across the room
I could tell that you were curious
Girl, I hope you’re sure what you’re looking for
‘Cause I’m not good at making promises
But if you like causing trouble
Up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things
You know that we shouldn’t do
Baby, I’m perfect
Baby, I’m perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving
With the windows down
And if you like going places
We can’t even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you’ve been dreaming about
Baby, you’re perfect
Baby, you’re perfect
So let’s start right now
