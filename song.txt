I might never be
Your knight in shining armor
I might never be the one
You take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight

When I first saw you
From across the room
I could tell that you were curious
Girl, I hope you’re sure what you’re looking for
‘Cause I’m not good at making promises
